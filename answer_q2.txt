q2:

The main idea will be to "hurt" the images resolution by multiplying it by k
and at the end to divide it back with k.

Full Answer:
1. corruption function - The corruption function will receive an image (patch)
 - taken from the high resolution function,first,it will reduce its size by k,
  and then it will increase its size by k (default value for k will be 2).
  A good solution for the resizing with 2 will be using gaussian pyramid.
 This corruption function will hurt the image resolution.

2. restore_image - We recall that restore image uses the base model to restore
full images of any size. Therefore, we will increase by k the image size,
use the function build nn model and build a correct model for it, and then we
will give it to our network.
