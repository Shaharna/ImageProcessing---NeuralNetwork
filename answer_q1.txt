q1:

As we can see in the plots attached, in the deblurring mission as the number
of the residual blocks increase the error decreases.
We can understand that as the network gets deeper it has more weights to learn
and therefore preforms better.
On the other hand, we can see that in the denoising mission the minimum point
of the error is when the number of residual blocks is 4, and the maximum error
at the plot is when the number of residual blocks is 3. I can only assume it
had happened due to overfitting.
